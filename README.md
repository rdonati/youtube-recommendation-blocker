# Youtube Recommendation Blocker

## What is it?
This repo contains a chrome extension that blocks YouTube recommendations
## Why do I need this?

I started this project to solve **two problems**:
1. YouTube's recommendations makes it easy to get sidetracked when trying to get tasks done.
2. Recommendation systems are taking over. People should browse more actively and intentionally.

The problem is more widespread than YouTube. Eventually, I'd like to extend the extension to include other sites, but YouTube is where I am going to start.
